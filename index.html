<b>Sketch Premise Generator and Other Writing Tools</b><br><br>This is <a target ="_self" href="https://twitter.com/estevangalvez">Estevan Galvez</a>'s extremely basic GitHub site.<br>Here you can find some simple web applets I've made.
<br><br>
<a target="_self" href="./spg.html"><b>My Sketch Premise Generator is available here.</b></a> It generates silly ideas.<br>A more accurate name would be "Premise Generator" since you can use it for pretty much anything, but I don't feel like changing the name so long after the original release.
<br><br>
Here's a simpler word-pairing / word-grouping applet called <a target="_self" href="./wgen.html">Word Group Generator.</a>
<br><br>
Here's a <a target="_self" href="./storygen.html">Story Generator</a> based on Sketch Premise Generator.
<br>It generates story prompts in a brief "base world -> inciting incident" format.
<br>Note: Even once you have full premises generated, you can re-click the button to re-generate them with different inciting incidents.
<br><br>
Here's a <a target="_self" href="./sghybrid.html">Hybrid Story Generator</a>, taking starts from Story Generator and conflicts from Sketch Premise Generator (the best of both worlds maybe).
<br><br><br>
Other variants which are literally just "reskins" of Sketch Premise Generator and Story Generator:
<br><br>
<a target="_self" href="./cgen.html">Conflict Generator</a> (Sketch Premise Generator re-contextualized)
<br><br>
<a target="_self" href="./igen.html">Inciting Incident Generator</a> (part of Story Generator isolated)
<br><br>
<a target="_self" href="./igen2.html">Inciting Incident Generator 2</a> (Sketch Premise Generator re-contextualized, again)
<br><br><br>
<b>LEGAL NOTICE: I hereby release the rights of all premises, concepts, word groups, ideas, etc. generated with these tools to you, the end user.</b><br>Otherwise they'd be super pointless. Just thought I'd put this in writing to be safe.
