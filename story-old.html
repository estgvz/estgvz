<h1>8-Section Story</h1>
A fairly universal strong story structure. Based on Script Lab's 8 sequence model, with some minor changes made so I could understand them better. By Estevan Galvez.<br><br>
(these aren't equal in length, the lengths depend on the story)
<p>1. <b>Current World & Inner Desires</b>
	<br>2. <b>Inciting Incident & Major Decision</b>
	<br>3. <b>The New World / The Quest Begins</b>
	<br>4. <b>Obstacles, Learning & Escalation</b>
	<br>5. <b>Game-Changer (or False Victory) & Response</b>
	<br>6. <b>Breakdown</b> (Major Failure Due to Unresolved Internal Conflict)
	<br>7. <b>Culmination</b> (Internal & External Conflicts Defeated or Succumbed To)
	<br>8. <b>Aftermath</b>
	<br><br>Note: I wrote "defeated or succumbed to" because the conflicts are defeated in a positive ending and succumbed to in a tragic one.

<h1>Alternative "5 Turns" model</h1>
<p>The 8 sections can be reduced into 5 turns by eliminating the steps that by themselves don't represent a major turn in the story:<br><br>
1. <b>Catalyst</b>
<br>2. <b>Threshold Crossed / New World</b>
<br>3. <b>Game-Changer or False Victory</b>
<br>4. <b>Breakdown</b>
<br>5. <b>Culmination</b></p>
<h1>What makes a story?</h1>
<p><b>A story is how one or more characters deal with a major and unavoidable event, change, task, or decision.</b><br><br>"Once, there was (blank). One day, (blank), and it changed everything..."</p>
<h1>Order & Chaos</h1>
<p>Order and Chaos exist on a spectrum, with order on one side and chaos on the other. The more order, the less chaos there is, and the more chaos, the less order there is. The nature of our universe is that any system experiences a never-ending cycle from times of chaos to times of order, over and over again, and this can be seen anywhere in life, particularly human history. Chaos eventually becomes order, order eventually becomes chaos again. This happens because while our universe is chaotic and tends toward chaos, it's so chaotic that order can always eventually form, but since it's not impervious to chaos, it's not permanent. That's the cycle.<br><br>
It's theorized that the reason we respond so well to stories that concern <b>how one or more characters deal with a major and unavoidable event, change, task, or decision</b> is that this story structure begins with order, introduces unavoidable chaos, and then shows how that chaos is eventually overcome to make way for a new order. It follows the same basic structure as how things work in life.<br><br>
Order -> Chaos -> New Order<br><br>
ACT 1 - Order Becomes Chaos<br>
ACT 2A - Chaos Decreases<br>
ACT 2B - Chaos Increases<br>
ACT 3 - Chaos Becomes Order<br><br>
Act 2 as a whole would be "Confronting the Chaos"<br><br>
In the 8-section model, chaos is there from sections 2-7, while 1 and 8 contain order.<br><br>If you're wondering how order/chaos would factor into a story that's just about someone pursuing their dream, chaos enters their life when the inciting incident happens that makes them realize they must pursue the dream.<br><br>Even in a low-stakes romance, chaos enters when the love interests meet (the inciting incident) because now things are unavoidably different. Just remember that chaos always strikes with the inciting incident.</p>
<h1>Why do we need the game-changer and breakdown?</h1>
<p>This is a good question. I actually wondered this myself for a long time. We all basically understand that these two plot points (especially the breakdown) make a story more interesting, but why? What would happen if a movie just had its inciting incident, started the quest, and then things progressed fairly linearly until the climax, with no sudden changes of tension between? Why does that sound boring? In truth, I don't fully know. Robert McKee says that most people who were raised in the culture of Western storytelling need to see at least 3 "reversals" (dramatic changes of fortune, same as my use of "turns") between the inciting incident of a story and the end of a story in order to feel satisfied, but you would need to do a lot of research into the history of storytelling to understand why. My 5 turns model fits what he says. It's worth noting that there are many examples of Indian, Asian, etc stories that are beloved and don't contain at least 3 reversals, and many don't follow the order->chaos->order model at all.</p>

<h1>Short film structure</h1>
<p>Just remember you only have a few minutes at most for each section. You can save time by reducing the amount of time between the start of the film and the inciting incident (you can also start at Section 3 and fill in the backstory later), and/or reducing the amount of time between the culmination and the end of the film. (Many short films end as soon as the climax happens.) You can also not have Section 5, as long as the Breakdown still feels earned, but it might weaken it.<br><br>
1. Current World & Inner Desires
	<br>2. Inciting Incident & Major Decision
	<br>3. The New World / The Quest Begins
	<br>4. Obstacles, Learning & Escalation
