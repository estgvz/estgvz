<h1>8-Section Story</h1>
A fairly universal story structure. Based on Script Lab's 8 sequences, with some minor changes made so I could understand them better.<br><br>
(these aren't equal in length, the lengths depend on the story)
<p>1. <b>Hook, Ordinary World, Inner Desires</b>
	<br>2. <b>Inciting Incident & Major Decision</b>
	<br>3. <b>The New World / The Quest Begins</b>
	<br>4. <b>Obstacles, Learning & Escalation</b>
	<br>5. <b>Game-Changer (or False Victory) & Response</b>
	<br>6. <b>Breakdown</b> (Major Failure Due to Unresolved Internal Conflict)
	<br>7. <b>Culmination</b> (Internal & External Conflicts Defeated or Succumbed To)
	<br>8. <b>Aftermath</b>
	<br><br>Note: I wrote "defeated or succumbed to" because the conflicts are defeated in a positive ending and succumbed to in a tragic one.
