<h1>8-Section Story</h1>
A fairly universal strong story structure. Based on Script Lab's 8 sequence model, with some minor changes made so I could understand them better. By Estevan Galvez.<br><br>
(these aren't equal in length, the lengths depend on the story)
<p>1. <b>Current World & Inner Desires</b>
	<br>2. <b>Inciting Incident & Major Decision</b>
	<br>3. <b>New World / Quest Started</b>
	<br>4. <b>Obstacles, Learning & Escalation</b>
	<br>5. <b>Game-Changer (or False Victory) & Response</b>
	<br>6. <b>Breakdown</b> (Major Failure Due to Unresolved Internal Conflict)
	<br>7. <b>Culmination</b> (Internal & External Conflicts Defeated or Succumbed To)
	<br>8. <b>Aftermath</b>
	<br><br>Note: I wrote "defeated or succumbed to" because the conflicts are defeated in a positive ending and succumbed to in a tragic one.

<h1>Alternative "5 Turns" model</h1>
<p>The 8 sections can be reduced into 5 turns by eliminating the steps that by themselves don't represent a major turn in the story:<br><br>
1. <b>Catalyst</b>
<br>2. <b>Threshold Crossed</b>
<br>3. <b>Game-Changer or False Victory</b>
<br>4. <b>Breakdown</b>
<br>5. <b>Culmination</b></p>
<h1>What makes a story?</h1>
<p><b>A story is how one or more characters deal with a major and unavoidable event, change, task, or decision.</b><br><br>"Once, there was (blank). One day, (blank), and it changed everything..."</p>

<h1>Short film structure</h1>
<p>Just remember you only have a few minutes at most for each section. You can save time by reducing the amount of time between the start of the film and the inciting incident (you can also start at Section 3 and fill in the backstory later), and/or reducing the amount of time between the culmination and the end of the film. (Many short films end as soon as the climax happens.) You can also not have Section 5, as long as the Breakdown still feels earned, but it might weaken it.<br><br>
1. Current World & Inner Desires
	<br>2. Inciting Incident & Major Decision
	<br>3. New World / Quest Started
	<br>4. Obstacles, Learning & Escalation
	<br>5. Game-Changer (or False Victory) & Response
	<br>6. Breakdown
	<br>7. Culmination
	<br>8. Aftermath (Optional)</p>
