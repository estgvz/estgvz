<h1>8-Section Story</h1>
A fairly universal strong story structure. Based on Script Lab's 8 sequence model, with some minor changes made so I could understand them better. By Estevan Galvez.<br><br>
(these aren't equal in length, the lengths depend on the story)
<p>1. <b>Current World & Wants</b>
	<br>2. <b>Inciting Incident & Major Decision</b>
	<br>3. <b>New World / Quest Started</b>
	<br>4. <b>Obstacles, Learning & Escalation</b>
	<br>5. <b>Game-Changer & Response</b>
	<br>6. <b>Anti-Finale*</b> (Lowest Point or Assumed Happy Ending)
	<br>7. <b>Finale</b>
	<br>8. <b>Aftermath</b>
	<br><br><b>*</b>The protagonist(s) face the opposite fortune of the ending. If the ending is positive for them (even if bittersweet), Anti-Finale means Lowest Point. If the ending is technically tragic for them (even if things turn out to be relatively okay by the very end, like in a sitcom), Anti-Finale means Assumed Happy Ending.

<h1>Alternative "5 Turns" model</h1>
<p>The 8 sections can be reduced into 5 turns by eliminating the steps that by themselves don't represent a major turn in the story:<br><br>
1. <b>Inciting Incident</b>
<br>2. <b>New World / Quest Started</b>
<br>3. <b>Game-Changer</b>
<br>4. <b>Anti-Finale</b>
<br>5. <b>Finale</b></p>
<h1>What makes a story?</h1>
<p><b>A story is how one or more characters deal with a major and unavoidable event, change, task, or decision.</b><br><br>"Once, there was (blank). One day, (blank), and it changed everything..."</p>

COLD OPEN
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;0. Cold Open (Current World, or Episode Conflict Tease)
<br>
ACT 1
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1. Current World & Wants
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;2. Inciting Incident & Major Decision
<br>ACT 2A
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;3. New World / Quest Started
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;4. Obstacles, Learning & Escalation
<br>ACT 2B
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;5. Game-Changer & Response
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;6. Anti-Finale*
<br>ACT 3
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;7. Finale (Episode Conflict Concluded)
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;8. Aftermath (Things Are Basically Back to Normal)
<br><br>*It's also somewhat common for section 6 to not occur until act 3 has begun. In this case, act 2 usually ends with a turning point that sets up the finale.
<br><br>Tip: Most sitcom episodes are structured like tragedies. Meaning, Section 6 has an "everything is gonna work out" vibe, then everything goes wrong in the Finale. But then the spirits of the characters are usually restored ("oh well, that didn't work out, but...") during Aftermath, leaving the audience with a positive vibe.

<h1>Short film structure</h1>
<p>Just remember you only have a few minutes at most for each section. You can save time by reducing the amount of time between the start of the film and the inciting incident (you can also start at Section 3 and fill in the backstory later), and/or reducing the amount of time between the climax and the end of the film. (Many short films end as soon as the climax happens.) You can also not have Section 5, as long as Section 6 still feels earned, but it might weaken it.<br><br>
